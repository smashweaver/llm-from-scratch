# Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) - Ruby Implementation

This Ruby project explores the architecture of large language models (LLMs) by implementing core concepts such as tokenization, attention mechanisms, and transformers.

This project is inspired by the book ["Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)"](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

## Todo List

- [x] Set up the Ruby project
- [ ] Work with text data
- [ ] Code the attention mechanism
- [ ] Implement a GPT model from scratch
- [ ] Pretrain on unlabelled data
- [ ] Fine-tuning for classification
- [ ] Fine-tuning to follow instructions
